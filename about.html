<h4 class="bear">This is going to be off the grid and with no context so bear with me.</h4>
<p>Whenever someone is asked to describe themselves it's always like an old movie plot with Name,Profession & Location as variables init.
		And even if we know the story of a person, can we truely say that we know that person !!</p>
		<p>I believe you can never truely know a person, you can only observe them.</p>
		<p>I love to observe people around me. And I like to guess people's next move, in some situations this habbit of mine really helps me removing the barrier between me and that person, but sometimes it's just the <em>oppsite.</em></p>
		<p>In my earlier days I had this image of mine in my mind like an extroverted,outgoing person who has a lot of friends and a major <em>showoff</em>, but now when I think of myself I see a person in his dark room with a laptop on. AND BTW he's still a major<em>showoff.</em> </p>
		<p>For somedays am noticing that am neither an extrovert nor an introvert. it's like I ike I like being with friends but there's a threshold whenever that's broken am out.</p>
		<p>I always considered 'nerd' as a compliment though I never really got called as one, I mean don't you agree in every fucking movie where there's is actually a strong storyline there's a nerd playing the best role and we all love that character. He's smart,funny(at least to the audience),is not a total shithead like the main character and what more do you need. In my view nerds are way cooler than the main characters.Needless to say I consider myself a nerd. </p>
