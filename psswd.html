<h4>Well my life is a pretty well directed movie.</h4>
<p> It got every aspect needed to be called as a "psycho thriller". Let me tell you a very big part of my life in the shortest way possible.<br>
A boy fell in love with a beautiful girl in school, could not got his balls together to ask her out finally decided to text her number which he found from her best-friend. And just texted "hii" (Unknown to the very Tsunami ahead) and surprisingly got a call from the very same number.<br>

He eagerly received the call hoping to hear his love's voice on the other end of the call but instead heard the bitchiest bitch (i.e her mother).She was so pissed that "how a boy from the same class of her daughter's texted her 'hii'" and not knowing what to do the boy just hung up the phone.And hoped for all of that to end right there (but boy was I not in for a treat!!!)<br>
The next day that bitch got to the school and filed a complaint against me as I had intensionally harassed her daughter by sending her 'hii' in whatsapp.<br>
And my loving teachers did the best in beating the shit out of me and threaten to call my parents <em class="highlight">(remind you it was all because of a text 'hii')</em>
Then after that Trauma I eventually got in relationship with that girl (just talking btw no real relationship stuffs).<br>
It's lasted 2 years or so the next thing I heard was she getting married and we were just touching 18.<em>She got married</em><br>
I somehow got my shit together and went up for 2 years without any issues then out of nowhere she with her best-friend invited me to see Avatar 2 : the way of waters with them and Kruti(my friend and the boyfriend of her best-friend). I being a total nut job said yes to that and then she started texting at nights all day. I just slowly backed out of that cause I do not wanna end up right where I started.
<h4>This is all yet I'll keep you updated.</h4>
